## Introduction
Imagine you are planning a vacation to Spain and want to know what region you should visit. 
Allow your decision to be guided by Spain’s wine offerings.
We have analyzed a dataset to do just that and invite you to explore our findings!


## Data Processing
Technologies used:
- Cleaning & narrowing results
- SQLite database & Flask
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- Libraries
-- D3
-- Plotly
-- Leaflet
-- Bootstrap


## Regions and Wineries
As of 2019, Spain has 138 identifiable wine regions
Most widely planted wine-producing country (2.9 million acres), second largest producer of wine
Over 400 wine varieties
Mountain ranges influence the climate of several wine regions

## Ratings and Prices
Wine prices range from a few dollars to a few thousand Euros
Price is not the sole indicator of quality or popularity

## Price and Region
Wine prices range from a few dollars to a few thousand Euros
Price is not the sole indicator of quality or popularity


## Summary: Findings & Opportunities 


### Project Limitations
1. Disproportionate rating sample size skewed results
- False indicator of popularity, quality, and regional offerings


### Additional Prospects
1. Customized wine recommendations based on user flavor preference
2. Potential correlations between harvest year and ratings
3. Possible links between rating and price

### Future Development
1. Expansion to include datasets from other countries
2. Connect with travel sites for enhanced vacation planning
